# Virtual Spatial Awareness Navigation Through the use of Waypoints

This project is developed using Unity and can be run using any VR headset that is tethered to a PC. The purpose of this experiment is to test if human memory is sufficient for navigating virtual worlds, or if a waypoint and compass system will help.
